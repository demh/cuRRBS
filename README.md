## What is cuRRBS?

cuRRBS (customised Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) is an easy-to-use computational method that predicts what is the optimal combination of restriction enzymes and size range that should be used in order to enrich for any given set of sites of interest in any genome. In other words, by modifying two steps of the original RRBS protocol, cuRRBS generalises [RRBS](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v6/n4/full/nprot.2010.190.html).
