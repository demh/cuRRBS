## What is cuRRBS?

**cuRRBS** (customised Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) is an easy-to-use computational method that predicts what is the optimal combination of *restriction enzymes* and *size range* that should be used in order to enrich for any given set of sites of interest in any genome. In other words, by modifying two steps of the original protocol, cuRRBS generalises [RRBS](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v6/n4/full/nprot.2010.190.html). This allows to create 'personalised' reduced representations (i.e. subsets) of the genome, that make DNA methylation next-generation sequencing experiments more cost-effective.

## Getting started

Before being able to run cuRRBS in your computer, you will need to download and install the following software:

1. [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The programming language in which cuRRBS is written.
2. [NumPy](https://scipy.org/install.html#individual-packages). A Python module which contains many useful functions used by cuRRBS.

Afterwards, you can install cuRRBS in your computer by [direct download](https://github.com/demh/cuRRBS/archive/master.zip) or cloning it from this GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/demh/cuRRBS.git
```
